# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Diagnostic-_Classification

# This file mainly consists of Using the techniques for Grid Search and K-Fold cross-validation for Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.
## The Result are below:-

| Result  | Without HyperParameterTuning | With HyperParameterTuning |
| --- | --- |
| DecisionTree |    0.929824561404       |             0.912280701754  →not improved |
|Randomforest   |  0.923976608187         |           0.923976608187   →the same result|
|SVM             | 0.614035087719                    0.93567251462    →dramatically improved|
|kNearestNeighbor |0.93567251462            |         0.93567251462    →the same result |

### The default hyperparameters set of DecisionTree, Random forest and K-nearest neighbour looks not so bad.


### I learned how to use the Grid Search and K-Fold cross-validation techniques for different machine learning techniques for supervised algorithms
